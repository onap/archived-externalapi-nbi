Introduction

NBI stands for NorthBound Interface. It brings to ONAP a set of API that can
be used by external systems as BSS for example. These API are based on
**TMF API**.

Following illustration provides a global view about nbi architecture,
integration with other ONAP components and API resource/operation provided.

***********
API Version
***********

APIs are described with a  state version with “v” following the API Name,
e.g.:  'nbi/api/v3/productOrder'.
The schema associated with a REST API must have its version number aligned
with that of the REST API.

The version number has major, minor and revision numbers. E.g. v1.0.0
The version number (without the revision number) is held in the URI.

The major version number is incremented for an incompatible change.
The minor version number is incremented for a compatible change.
For minor modifications of the API, version numbering must not be updated,
provided the following  backward compatibility rules are respected:

- New elements in a data type must be optional (minOccurs=0)
- Changes in the cardinality of an attribute in a data type must be from
  mandatory to optional or from lower to greater
- New attributes defined in an element must be optional (absence of
  use=”required”).
- If new enumerated values are included, the former ones and its meaning must
  be kept.
- If new operations are added, the existing operations must be kept
- New parameters added to existing operations must be optional and existing
  parameters must be kept

For major modifications of the API, not backward compatible and forcing client
implementations to be changed, the version number must be updated.

API Description
***************

--------------
serviceCatalog
--------------

From TMF633 serviceCatalog

API at a glance:
Only high level information are provided - swagger is documented.

Only serviceSpecification resource is provided.
Information are retrieved in SDC (and in TOSCA file)
- Only GET operation is provided - this API DID NOT UPDATE SDC

Only characteristics at service level will be retrieved in ONAP TOSCA file.
For example if an ONAP service is composed of VNF and the VF module, the
serviceSpecification resource will only feature characteristic describe in
the ONAP service tosca model and not attributes in the tosca files for VNF
or VF module.

Only ‘basic’ service characteristics will be managed in this release. By
‘basic’ we mean string, boolean, integer parameter type and we do not manage
‘map’ or ‘list’ parameter type.


**GET serviceSpecification(list)**

Example: ``GET /nbi/api/v3/serviceSpecification/?category=NetworkService
&distributionStatus=DISTRIBUTED``

It is possible to retrieve a list of serviceSpecification (get by list).

Only attributes category and distributionStatus are available for
serviceSpecification filtering. It is possible to select retrieved attributes
using fields attribute.

If no serviceSpecification matches, an empty list is send back.

**GET service Specification (id)**

Example: ``GET /nbi/api/v3/serviceSpecification/{uuid}``

It is use to retrieve one serviceSpecification - all available information are
retieved (see swagger for description)

----------------
serviceInventory
----------------

From TMF638 serviceInventory

API at a glance:
Only high level information are provided - swagger is documented.

This API retrieves service(s) in the AAI inventory. Only following attributes
will be retrieve in service inventory: ``id``, ``name``, ``state`` and ``type``
.

**GET Service Inventory (list)**

Example: ``GET /nbi/api/v3/service/?relatedParty.id=Pontus``

GET (by list) allows to request with following criteria (all optional) :

*   ``id`` (id of the service instance) - id of the service instance
    (inventory)
*   ``serviceSpecification.id`` - id of the service specification (catalog)
*   ``serviceSpecification.name`` - name of the service specification (catalog)
*   ``relatedParty.id`` - id of the (aai) customer - if not filled we use
    ‘generic’ customer

if no service matches, an empty list is send back.

1. If a request is send without any parameter, we’ll retrieve the list of
   service-instance for the ‘generic’ customer
2. If only customer parameter is filled (relatedParty.id +
   role= relatedParty’ONAPcustomer’) we’ll retrieve the list of
   service-instance for this customer
3. If serviceSpecification.id or name is filled we’ll retrieve the list of
   Service instance (from this service specification) – We’ll use the customer
   id if provided (with Role=’ONAPcustomer) or generic if no customer id
   provided

**GET Service Inventory (id)**

Example: ``GET /nbi/api/v3/service/{uuid}`` but ``customerId`` &
``serviceSpecification.id`` must passed in requested parameters


Because of AAI capability, additionally to the service id, customer id and
``serviceSpecification.id`` or ``serviceSpecification.name`` must be supplied.
If the customer id is not supplied, External API will use ‘generic’ customer

------------
serviceOrder
------------

From TMF641 serviceOrder

API at a glance:
Only high level information are provided - swagger is documented.

It is possible to use POST operation to create new ``serviceOrder`` in NBI and
triggers service provisioning. GET operation is also available to retrieve
one service order by providing id or a list of service order. For this release,
only a subset of criteria is available:

• ``externalId``
• ``state``
• ``description``
• ``orderDate.gt`` (orderDate must be greater – after -than)
• ``orderDate.lt`` (orderDate must be lower-before - than)
• ``fields`` – attribute used to filter retrieved attributes (if needed) and
  also for sorted SO
• ``offset`` and ``limit`` are used for pagination purpose

ServiceOrder will manage following actioItem action:

• ``add`` - a new service will be created
• ``delete`` - an existing service will be deleted
• ``change`` - an existing service will be deleted and then created with new
  attribute value

prerequisites & assumptions :

• Cloud & tenant information MUST BE defined in the external API property file
• Management of ONAP customer for add service action

With the current version of APIs used from SO and AAI we need to manage a
‘customer’. This customer concept is confusing with Customer BSS concept.
We took the following rules to manage the ‘customer’ information:

• It could be provided through a ``serviceOrder`` in the service Order a
  ``relatedParty`` with role ‘ONAPcustomer’ should be provided in the
  ``serviceOrder`` header (we will not consider in this release the party
  at item level); External API component will check if this customer exists
  and create it in AAI if not.
• If no ``relatedParty`` are provided the service will be affected to ‘generic’
  customer (dummy customer) – we assume this ‘generic’ customer always exists.
• Additionally nbi will create in AAI the service-type if it did not exists for
  the customer

ServiceOrder management in NBI will support 2 modes:

• E2E integration - NBI call SO API to perform an End-To-end integration
• Service-level only integration - nbi will trigger only SO request at
  serviceInstance level -->  ONAPSO prerequisite: SO must be able to find a
  BPMN to process service fulfillment (integrate vnf, vnf activation in SDNC,
  VF module

The choice of the mode is done in NBI depending on information retrieved in
SDC. If the serviceSpecification is within a Category “E2E Service” , NBI will
use E2E SO API, if not only API at service instance level will be used.

There is no difference or specific expectation in the service order API used
by NBI user.

ServiceOrder tracking

State management: States are only managed by ServiceOrder component and could
not be updated from north side via API.
Accordingly to service order item fulfillment progress, order item state are
updated. Order state is automatically updated based on item state.
Additionnally to this state, NBI provided a completion percent progress to have
detailled information about order progress.
Order Message are retrieved in the GET serviceOrder to provide NBI used
addtionnal information about serviceOrder management.

**Notification:**

It is possible for an external system to subscribe to service order
notifications. 3 events are managed:

• A new service order is created in NBI
• A service order state changes.
• A service order item state changes

These 3 events have distinct notification allowing any system to subscribe to
one, two or all notification types.

The implementation will be split in 2 components:

• A HUB resource must be managed within the NBI/serviceOrder API. This HUB
  resource allows system to subscribe to NBI notification
• An Event API must be available at listener side in order to be able to
  receive Listener (when event occurs). NBI will be upgraded to use this API
  as client – NBI will shoot POST listener/
